The [SAMPL6 (Part II) logP Challenge](https://github.com/MobleyLab/SAMPL6/blob/master/logP_challenge_instructions.md) consists of predicting the octanol-water partition coefficients (log P) of 11 small molecules that resemble fragments of small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. Our aim is to evaluate how well current models can capture the transfer free energy of small molecules between different solvent environments through blind predictions.

* Nov 1, 2018 - SAMPL6 Part II Challenge start date
